tummy and it just looked so inviting. There were
about 20 tourists and locals on the pier, looking
at this lovely spectacle. Just after I got into the
water, Dusty left the woman she was with and
went crazy – I found out afterwards that she’s
very territorial when she is with somebody. Her
tail was flapping wildly and, at first, I thought it
was a display but, then, I realized she was angry.
I knew I had to get out of the water so I swam
towards the pier but, within seconds, Dusty
had crashed into me with her snout. It
was very powerful and painful, and the
speed was amazing. I was pushed
forwards violently.","That evening, the woman was tickling Dusty’s
