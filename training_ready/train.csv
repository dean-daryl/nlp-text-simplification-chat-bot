"The blame, most agree, sits with unsustainable
human consumption damaging ecosystems,
creating climate change and destroying
habitats at a far faster rate than previously
thought. But, this time, it’s not just the “big,
cuddly mammals” we have to worry about
losing but the smaller, less visible creatures
upon which we depend – insects, creepycrawlies
and even worms. They might not be
facing immediate extinction but a decline in
their numbers will affect us all. “We are going
to feel the impact of those losses. With the UK
species, the pattern is much the same with
invertebrates as it is with vertebrates. It’s not
as simplistic as ‘fish die and people starve’ –

"It has been a whirlwind week for the crews ofthe  otilla of four sailing canoes since arriving in Sydney for the start of the World Parks Congress.

invertebrates are declining just as fast as
vertebrates, with “serious consequences for
humanity”. “The really interesting thing about

"The key was to ensure that the way clouds form in the real world was accurately representedin computer climate models, which are theonly tool researchers have to predict future temperatures. When water evaporates from the oceans, the vapour can rise over nine miles to form rain clouds that reflect sunlight; or, it may rise just a few miles and drift back down without forming clouds. In reality, both processesoccur and climate models encompassing this complexity predicted significantly higher future temperatures than those only including the nine-mile-high clouds.","Computer climate models are the only tool researchers have to predict future temperatures and it was important to make sure that the way clouds are formed was represented accurately in those models.

Knowing how many children die and from what cause allows the world to focus its efforts and resources on keeping them alive. There are many lessons to be learnt from the enormous database they have put together, which will help global organizations and individual governments to better care for us all.","Over the past five years, the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) in Seattle has led a very big project to look at the global effects of disease. If we know how many children die and why, the world can try to keep them alive. The big IHME database will help global organizations and governments to better care for us all."

"The third big finding was, Murray said, “a surprise to us”. There is a lot of disability and it has a big effect on people who are living longer but not healthier lives. “The main causes of disability are different from the ones that kill you,” he said. They were mental health problems, such as anxiety and depression, and disorders, such as arthritis and lower back pain, anaemia, sight and hearing loss and skin disease. In addition, there was substance abuse. “The numbers for these are not going down over time,” he said. “We are making no progress in reducing these conditions.”","The third big result was, he said, “a surprise to us”.

"The offi ce cubicle
In the late 60s, a new form of offi ce was
